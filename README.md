This project explores the capabilities of a simple UNet and an advanced CleanUNet architecture for speech denoising and dereverberation tasks. The models are optimized through a set of losses defined over both waveform and multi-resolution spectrograms. A fine-tuning study of the CleanUNet model is performed focusing only on the reverberation denoising task. We use objective and qualitative evaluations to compare the models and the training.

Datasets can be generated simliraly using our scrpits along with the data from https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge
